# Game-Project-VR

A 2D Game that supports Virtual Reality. Think of it as standing before a really big screen and playing the game on it while controlling your character by pointing on the screen. The GUI is attached to the left controller (HTC Vive).

This project was designed and developed solely by myself.

This is the VR version of the game.
